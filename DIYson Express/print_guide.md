# Part Printing Guide

###### General note: All parts can be printed using a layer height of .2mm and a .4mm nozzle unless noted otherwise below. Also these are just the settings I use so feel free to experiment and let us know if you come across a better method.

**Base:**  
Orientation: As installed (large hole side on build plate)  
Supports: On build plate  
Settings: 6 perimeters and 40% infill  
Notes: This part really does need to be strong, I have snapped a couple after I forget to bump up the number of perimeters 

**Carriage Belt Clip:**  
Orientation: Smooth side down  
Supports: On build plate  
Settings: I like to use .1mm layer height and Prusa Slicer's adaptive layer height feature  

**Carriage:**  
Orientation: Belt clip slot facing up  
Supports: On build plate  
Settings: 6 perimeters and 40% infill  

**Charging Base (optional):**  
Orientation: USB cable cavity on build plate  
Supports: On build plate  
Settings: Default  

**Counterweight Belt Clip:**  
Orientation: Small screw holes on build plate  
Supports: On build plate (or painted on to only support the countersink holes)  
Settings: Default  

**Counterweight Flex Tab:**  
Orientation: Vertical  
Supports: None  
Settings: Default  

**Counterweight Enclosure:**  
Orientation: Belt clip slot facing up (might have to sping 45 degrees to fit your print surface)  
Supports: None  
Settings: At least 4 perimeters  

**Counterweight Lid:**  
Orientation: Small screw holes on build plate  
Supports: None  
Settings: Default  

**Desk Mount:**  
Orientation: As installed (vertically with flat face on build plate)  
Supports: None  
Settings: 6 perimeters and 40% infill  

**End Cap (optional):**  
Orientation: Small screw hole on build plate  
Supports: None

**End Cap (optional):**  
Orientation: As installed (linear rail inserts on build plate)  
Supports: On build plate  
Settings: Default  

**End Cap (optional):**  
Settings vary based on design, but the DIYson Express logo prints best with a .25mm nozzle. I print the Ulanzi L2 holder upside down (with the logo side on the build plate) and uses supports on the build plate to support the opening which reveal the buttons.
